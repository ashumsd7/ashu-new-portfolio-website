Meet my father **Mr. Awdhesh kumar Tiwari**

(Got government job in last chance of eligibility criteria)



My father's qualification is B.A. M.A. And B.ed .As a simple man, he was searching for a job for himself after completing his B.ed. Many vacancies had been released, but he was not selected because of less marks in his 10th and graduation; almost about 60% and the other reason was that he was a general category candidate. He applied many times for many teacher jobs but he always failed. He taught in many convent schools in the beginning and he used to get an amount of Rs.1000 per month. And last I remember his salary as a private teacher in an aided school was 4000 Rs per month. He taught English to intermediate students, and gave maths coaching to 8th grade students at our home and also taught in college. It seemed that he won't ever get a govt. job.

A life changing twist came in 2011 when he was 39 years and 10 months old.

You know in general category if you are 40 years old, you can't get a government job. In 2011 November, 72825 vacancies came for primary teachers during Mayawati government. In TET exam.. My Papa gave that exam and scored 121 out of 150. We were sure that happy times were about to come. But in 2012 when Akhilesh Government came in power, vacancies were cancelled. 2 years later, in 2014 , an order came from court to fill those vacancies. Then Akhilesh said that a candidate can apply in a district with 500 Rs per Demand Draft or each of the districts simultaneously.



This was the last chance for my father, he was 42 years old but fortunately he was in because vacancies came in 2011 when he was eligible. My father took a loan of almost 20000 Rs from a bank and applied in more than 40 districts. Result came and that day was the happiest day for my family. My father had a chance to go to more than 35 districts. And he selected Gonda which is at a 100 km distance from my home near Ayodhya. And now he is a teacher in a government primary school, and his salary is 30k per month. This is the story of my father.



Thanks.
