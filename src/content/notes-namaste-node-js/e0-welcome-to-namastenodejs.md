## About the Creator 
(The Boss, Akshay Saini)

Akshay started building websites in the 7th or 8th grade and has since worked at Paytm, Uber, Lendingkart, and multiple startups, where he learned how to develop large-scale projects. He even started a startup while still in college. Throughout his career, one of the key factors that has helped him succeed is being curious. He believes that having curiosity and the desire to learn new things will help you continually improve. He encourages you to ask questions, as this will significantly benefit your career. Akshay urges you to maintain this curiosity during the course as well.
