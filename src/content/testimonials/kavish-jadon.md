Dear Ashutosh


Here’s the revised version with Akshay Saini's course name included:

I just finished reading your notes for the "NamasteNodejs" course, and I have to say, they’re an absolute gem. You’ve managed to turn what could have been a standard tech lesson into something deeply engaging and uniquely creative.

What I loved most is how you depicted the theory through trending memes, diagrams, and even poems. This creative approach not only made the concepts easier to grasp but also made the learning experience fun and memorable. It’s clear that you didn’t just want to teach Node.js—you wanted to make sure we enjoyed the process along the way.

Your ability to strike a balance between humor and technical clarity is impressive. You made us feel connected, not just with the content, but also with the community you’ve built through this engaging style. It’s a refreshing reminder that learning doesn’t have to be dry—it can be vibrant and full of life, much like the way you’ve presented it.

And of course, I owe a great thanks to Akshay Saini, the creator of "NamasteNodejs," for developing such an incredible course. Your notes have added another layer of value to his teaching, making the experience truly special.

## Ashutosh, you’ve done something truly remarkable with this piece. It’s not just a story about a tech team; it’s a celebration of friendship, trust, and the joy of creating something meaningful together. Thank you for sharing this with us—it's a story that will stick with me for a long time."
