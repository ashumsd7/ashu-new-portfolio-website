Dear Ashutosh
I just finished reading your article, "[KANKHAR: A Full Stack Framework (of Friendship)](https://heyashu.in/digital-garden/blog/kankhar-a-full-stack-friendwork)," and I have to tell you, it’s an absolute gem. You’ve managed to take what could have been a typical tech story and turned it into something deeply human and incredibly engaging.

What struck me most is how you’ve captured the essence of teamwork and friendship. You didn’t just tell a story about a group of developers—you made us feel like we were right there with you, sharing in the late-night coding sessions, the jokes, and the shared meals. It’s clear that KANKHAR isn’t just a team; it’s a family, and that’s something truly special.

Your narrative style is both playful and poignant, striking the perfect balance between humor and heart. The cultural references you’ve woven in give the story a rich texture that makes it relatable and vibrant, even to those outside the tech world. You’ve shown that the success of KANKHAR isn’t just in the code you all wrote, but in the bonds you formed along the way.

In a world where the focus often leans heavily on results and efficiency, your story is a refreshing reminder that the relationships we build are just as important, if not more so, than the work itself. You’ve beautifully illustrated that great work stems from great relationships, and that’s a message that resonates deeply.

## Ashutosh, you’ve done something truly remarkable with this piece. It’s not just a story about a tech team; it’s a celebration of friendship, trust, and the joy of creating something meaningful together. Thank you for sharing this with us—it's a story that will stick with me for a long time."
